I care about how systems fail, how they recover, and the small decisions that shape their long-term behavior.

The work here is a mix of experiments, guardrails, and ideas that refused to stay in my head.

The pinned repos tell the rest.

I enjoy building things that matter and solving problems no one asked for.
